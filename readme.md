## Ping Pong Scheduler
  Users can create a profile and log-in to view or create ping-pong matchups against other users.

  Ping-Pong events can be created for individual games. Users can click on One Time Play! and see a list of users and invite them to play a game. On the home screen, once logged in, a user can see all pending games, completed games, and the options to create a new game using the buttons.
